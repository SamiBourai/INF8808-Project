      The following chart is a parallel coordinate chart that represents the numbers the teams had
      in multiple categories. These categories include the number of attempted passes, the number of goal-creating actions,
      the number of recoveries, the number of tackles, and the number of interceptions. This visualization provides
      an efficient way to compare teams on key game performance metrics. 
      For example, <span class="morocco">Morocco</span> was the team with the second highest number of interceptions in game but they were the 
      worst in attempted passes.
